________
*An experimental in-development multi-function bot for Discord for file storage and text-based games with a matrix theme.*
***Details***
```ini
Written in TypeScript/JavaScript using the dblapi and discord.js api. The plan for this bot is at some point
to have a text-based virtual world where people on Discord servers can interact, use/exchange in-game items,
fight, and other stuff. Alongside the RPG world, the bot could also act as a multi-purpose utility bot
for music and server administration/management.
```
***Commands***
```fix
!mhelp			Displays available commands
```
